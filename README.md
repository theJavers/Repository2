## Game Instructions

When game starts you have to choose between two options:
1. Play with a `random party` or choose from a `CSV file.` 
NOTE: when creating a party from a CSV file take in to consideration that the file explorer does not come on top of other windows, make sure to minimize your text editor. 2 default CSV are provided (party1.csv, party2.csv 
2. Once your party is picked both teams are created and you have to choose a `fighter` to battle against another player. Players will be generated with random stats and they will be either `Warriors` or `Wizards`.
3. After pressing `enter` the battle will start.
4. After the battle is finished, one character of either side will be the `winner`.
5. You can check the battle `details` to decide if you still continue playing with the same one or choose a different fighter, but be aware that if you are hurt, your health will still be the same. You can also check in the `graveyard` which fighter has fallen.
6. When one of the two party loses all their fighter, the game will finish and a `winner` will be announced.
